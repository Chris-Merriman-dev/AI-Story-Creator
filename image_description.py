        You will conduct 5 separate, independent evaluations of the following image compared to the description provided.

        For each evaluation:
        - Approach the image and text as if seeing them for the first time.
        - Compare the following text with the image: "{description}".
        - Assess how accurately the image reflects or contrasts with the text.

        Evaluate the following:
        1. Confirm the **approximate number of visible humans** matches the description. If any described human character is entirely missing, note this as an error.
        2. For **visible humans only**, check for any obvious anatomy errors (such as extra heads, missing arms, or misplaced body parts). If any such issue is detected on a human, reduce the score by **20% per instance**.
        3. Ignore anatomy for any non-human characters (such as monsters, animals, or creatures) unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description.
        4. Verify that the **overall clothing style, props, and environmental setting** generally match the description. Do not judge minor details unless glaringly wrong. Any significant mismatch should reduce the score by **10% per issue**.
        5. Assess whether the **lighting, color palette, and mood** of the scene match the tone described. Major deviations should reduce the score by **10%**.

        After completing all 5 evaluations, calculate the **average score** on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00, where 0.00 indicates no similarity and 1.00 indicates perfect similarity.

        Please return **ONLY the final average score** with no individual evaluations or explanations.
